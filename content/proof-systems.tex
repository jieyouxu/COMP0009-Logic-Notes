\chapter{Proof Systems}

\begin{definition}[Proof System]
    A \Keyword{proof system} is used to determine the \textit{validity} of formulas.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    A trivial system would be to generate the truth table for some formula $\phi$ and
    check all rows yield $\top$. But for $n$ variables we will need $2^n$ rows which
    explodes exponentially.
    
    Thus, we need another system, which analyzes the syntax of the formula to
    determine its validity.
    
    Changes on syntactical level may not be semantics-preserving. To ensure that
    syntactical transformations are semantics-preserving, it is critical that the
    proof system used is both \Keyword{sound} and \Keyword{complete}.
    
    Let
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\models \phi$ \quad denote $\phi$ is \textit{valid}.
        \item $\vdash \phi$ \quad denote there exists a \textit{proof} of $\phi$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\section{Soundness and Completeness}

\begin{definition}[Soundness]
    A proof system is \Keyword{sound} iff it can \textit{only} prove \textit{valid} formulas.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \vdash \phi \implies \models \phi
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Completeness]
    If a formula is \textit{valid}, then the proof system \textit{can} prove it.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \models \phi \implies \vdash \phi
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}
